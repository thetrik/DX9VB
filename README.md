# DX9VB
 Direct3D9 for Visual Basic 6

The repository contains type library "DirectX 9 for Visual Basic 6.0 type library by The trick" (dx9vb.tlb) which describes the following interfaces:

IDirect3D9;
IDirect3DDevice9;
IDirect3DSurface9;
IDirect3DResource9;
IDirect3DSwapChain9;
IDirect3DTexture9;
IDirect3DBaseTexture9;
IDirect3DVolumeTexture9;
IDirect3DVolume9;
IDirect3DCubeTexture9;
IDirect3DVertexBuffer9;
IDirect3DIndexBuffer9;
IDirect3DStateBlock9;
IDirect3DVertexDeclaration9;
IDirect3DVertexShader9;
IDirect3DPixelShader9;
IDirect3DQuery9.

The library declared many types, constants and enumerations as well. 

Repository includes several modules written in VB6:

D3DX_COLOR.bas - working with colors;
D3DX_MATRICES.bas - working with matrices;
D3DX_QUATERNION.bas - working with quaternions;
D3DX_VECTOR2.bas, D3DX_VECTOR3.bas, D3DX_VECTOR4.bas - working with vectors;
D3DX_MISC.bas - the miscellaneous functions.

These modules include the analogs of the corresponding D3DX functions.

The type library d3dxvb.tlb (D3DX for Visual Basic 6.0 type library by The trick) contains the several D3DX interfaces:

ID3DXBuffer;
ID3DXConstantTable;
ID3DXInclude.

Those interfaces with the some declared structures/enums/constatns allow to compile shaders using a d3dx9_XX.dll libary.
